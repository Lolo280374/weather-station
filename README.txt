- About this project
This project was made as part of my two week required internship by the French Ministry of Education for my grade. I was for one week at Epitech, one of the leading computer science schools in France. We learnt a couple of projects there, including this weather app example. I've decided to post it here for fun, because I want to have stuff to showcase on this app!

- About me?
I'm lolodotzip. Not my real name of course, more a go-to username. I love animes, and tech as a whole, and I'm thinking of going in IT to become a developer or a sysadmin. Both paths really appeal me!

- Can I talk to you?
Of course! You can reach me on GitHub, where I have most of my socials, on Discord at "@lolo.zip", or even via mail at "lolodotzip@proton.me".

- Roadmap?
None really. I'm gonna add stuff here and there to make the app more "polished", and make it look presentable to someone who would be here to check it out. I have bigger projects planned tho, which are more interesting than this, stay stuned I guess?
